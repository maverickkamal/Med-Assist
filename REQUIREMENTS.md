2. The website should be secure and protect user data.
3. The website should be easy to use and navigate.

6. Home page should have a detailed introduction to the website and what it does.
7. The website should be built using React, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.
8. The website should have a beautiful UI/UX design suitable for doctors and yes should be easy to navigate.
9. The website should have a modern look and feel, animations should be smooth and not distracting.
10. The colors should be blue and purple gradient hues. it should be modern and beautiful.

## Pages

1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Settings Page(accessible only when signed in)
4. Sign In Page
5. Sign Up Page
6. Contact Us Page

## Components

1. sign in form should contain email, password, and a sign in button.
2. sign up form should contain email, password, confirm password, and a next button. when the next button is clicked it should ask for name, hospital name and medical specialty(drop down).
3. settings page should contain user profile information, upload profile picture, and a button to change password.
4. Use modern or even futuristic icons and components. like menu button shouldn't be a hamburger button.


## Technologies

1. React
2. Typescript
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Shadcn UI(you're not limited to just using shadcn ui components, you can use other components as well)
5. Lucide Icons
6. Framer Motion
7. Supabase for authentication and database.

## Logic

1. When the user clicks on the sign in button, it should open the sign in form.
2. When the user clicks on the sign up button, it should open the sign up form.
3. When the user clicks on the next button in the sign up form, it should ask for name, hospital name and medical specialty.
4. When the user clicks on the sign in button in the sign in form, it should sign in the user.
5. When the user clicks on the sign up button in the sign up form, it should create a new user in the database.
6. When the user is signed in, should lead to chat page.
7. chat page should be accessible when user is signed in.
8. Design should be glassmorphism design.
9. Also add the forget password functionality, also add the email verification functionality and if user is not verified then don't allow them to access the chat page.
10. If user is not new then a link to sign in should be shown on the top right corner of the page. 


Analyze the requirements and everything carefully before starting to code.
